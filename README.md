# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
Fraud detection is an important application of machine learning in the financial sector. 
With the increase in online transactions, fraudulent activities have also increased rapidly.
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing historical transaction data 
using machine learning algorithms.

The system classifies transactions as **fraudulent** or **legitimate** with high accuracy and 
helps reduce financial loss.
